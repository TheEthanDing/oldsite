What a weekend. What a week. Nine days, two nights of sleep: I learned so much working with pharmaceutical device startup Compassionlit. Most entrepreneur stories are pretty amazing, but Nicolle was something else: she had an incredibly optimistic attitude no matter how much red tape she stumbled across. To meet someone who was working a regular occupation (nursing), recognized potential in their own idea and DROPPED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE to pursue it is truly something eye opening, and provides me a lot of perspective.

Compassionlit is a startup that produces phototherapy devices that help treat jaundiced newborns at 1% of the market price for comparable devices. They're very small at the moment, and only just trying to get off their feed, but their website can be found [here](http://box5653.temp.domains/~compauf8/).

I helped Nicolle do market research for Ethiopia and Thailand, constructed a consumer journey to help her narrow down what kind of focuses she would need, and sketched out a go-to-market strategy for the Thailand market.

Sleep depravation aside, I can't wait to start pitching CashMoney.
