CashMoney: "it's Uber for tasks... for students"

How did we get here? CashMoney is going to be my first attempt at creating my own startup. Pitching to the Convergent team was fun but I doubt that's going to be of much value. I have to smooth out my wireframe for the Deloitte startup competition pitch too. I just can't shake the feeling that I need more experience before going all in
