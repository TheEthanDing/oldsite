[Pitch Deck](https://ethanding17.github.io/assets/Deloitte-Powerpoint-FINAL.pptx)

Continuous 72 hours from project launch to final pitch to judges; the Deloitte Startup competition has just concluded, and there's a fair amount to reflect on. The first thing to note is that mine and one other team easily did the most amount of work on our presentation, including the decking and presentation elements, yet neither of our teams placed on the top three.

Initially this was a pretty rough disappointment, but I think there's a lot that I learned from speaking to the judges afterwards. As lucrative our idea was, it was poorly communicated as my team got too focused on making our deck as concise and informative as possible, and going over the specific elements we were each going to say. Moreover, we weren't all on the same page, because we tried to pivot the team (or at least I managed to), but we weren't all present at every meeting. None of us really took charge of the project either, so there was no overall vision guiding us towards a proverbial "final destination", which really showed in our work. The other team fell short where the judges noticed that it seemed like 3/5 of their members did all the work/talking, and as a result two of them didn't manage to get the opportunity to say anything during their presentation.

Our idea was to have stations in areas trafficked highly by students and young professionals which would facilitate transactions between people who would rent professional outfits and people who would need a professional outfit in a pinch. It would bring convenience, ease of use, since it would save people the trouble of having to come already dressed, potentially long distances, and arrive sweaty and disheveled at interviews. However, we really weren't able to drill in that last part, because initially our plan was simply to have exchanges take place where people would go to pick up outfits at other people's homes.

Also during the presentation we went over time, and I was in charge of financials, and I didn't get a chance top prove my concept.

Everything's a learning experience after all.
