<h1>Gamestop: Long</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Gamestop is a brick and mortar video game, consumer electronics and gaming merchandise retailer; its revenue consists of even break downs between used video game products (used games, accessories etc.), new video game software (new video games),  new video game hardware (Xbox, Playstation), and digital products / consumer electronics / retail (mouses, speakers, headsets). It simultaneously straddles two shifting industry sectors: the brick and mortar retail sector and video games; currently the threat that Amazon and ecommerce are posing to the brick and mortar retail industry seems to be dramatically over shadowing the growth of the gaming industry.

<h3>Recent News / Trends / Street’s Opinion</h3>

Since 2013, Gamestop’s stock has been hemorrhaging value, as they failed to pivot in the face of Amazon’s rising dominance. Currently it trades at around $4.23 a share with a market cap of $430 million, down from 2013 peak of $55.48 6 years ago. It entered into acquisition talks early January this year, which were promptly concluded at the end of January, which account for the brief surge and subsequent crash around that time. It has since been losing value steadily, with another crash in June 4th when this year’s first quarterly report saw another loss, the removal of the stock’s dividend payouts, as well as the detailed plans of a company overhaul under the new CEO, George Sherman, who joined Gamestop in April (more on him later). Currently Gamestop is the most heavily shorted stock in the market, which is a pretty good indicator of what “the Street” thinks (beating out Bed Bath & Beyond with 56% of shares outstanding short as of August 9th). All of this is in anticipation of the second quarterly report due to be released on Tuesday, September 10th.

<h3>Value Prop / Variant Perspective / Competitive Advantage</h3>

The new CEO, George Sherman, hails from Best Buy, another brick and mortar company that struggled under the competitive pressure of Amazon and ecommerce. In 2012, Best Buy was trading at ~$11, but after an complete company overhaul (the same kind that Sherman promises to bring to Gamestop), Best Buy stock recovered and is now trading at ~ $60 a share. Brick and mortar companies which have thrived despite the ecommerce age have done so by building an “experience” around their store, which aligns with Sherman’s plans to reinvest dividends into overhauling Gamestop stores from being “shops” to being “gaming hubs”, which also lets it focus on capitalizing on the booming video game industry, which has projected 9.7% CAGR over the next five years. Gamestop’s competitive advantage comes from its stores and its brand with console gaming. Online retailers like Steam never captured the Xbox and PS4 audience, who make up 30% of the $200 billion market. Additionally, since August 15th, Gamestop stock has actually recovered, which positions the company for a potential short squeeze in the lead up to the second quarterly earnings report. The “street” is too caught up with the stock’s hemorrhaging over the past few years, and has allowed it become incredibly undervalued in the face of a major company overhaul.

Since the second quarterly report may swing the stock unpredictably, I would recommend buying a long position after shortly after the report comes out on Tuesday to mitigate risk.
