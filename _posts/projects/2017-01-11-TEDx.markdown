<h1> Judge Not </h1>

Debate's always been a part of my life: my parents were never the kind to just roll with my lofty claims or ideas as a child. From a very young age, my parents encouraged and drilled me to explore and analyze the "Why" behind every question I asked. As I developed my own personal values and ideologies, I found myself drifting towards determinism, an philosophical doctrine that, if taken consistently, I felt would promote the highest level of empathy for our fellow man.

I was so excited to share my insights that I gave up the opportunity to organize TEDx in favour of having the opportunity to speak.
