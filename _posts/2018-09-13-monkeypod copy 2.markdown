As part of E27 - Engineering Manufacturing, I was put into a team of five to develop a phone attachment which would provide "some functionality". Project specs were scarce to encourage creativity, although looking back we probably went too far with our product.

<h4> Our Product </h4>

We decided to design a "Monkey Pod", a flexible tripod with claws that would bind to a phone in order for people to set up creatively positioned photos. It was inspired by the Gorillapod, which serviced cameras. I undertook the roles of Finance and Manufacturing lead for the project. The shear number of parts we needed to print out, as well as the perfection required, in terms of tolerance, to produce leg nodes that would both fit into each other and slide smoothly over each other, was overwhelming.

A few sleepless nights of 3d printing later, we were able to proudly present our PLA plastic (incredibly difficult to make smooth) Monkey Pod, that could stand steadily across a multitude of diverse surfaces, and be equipped with a variety of phone types.
