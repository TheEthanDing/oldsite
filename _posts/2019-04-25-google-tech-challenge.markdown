25 April

Google Tech Challenge wasn't quite what I expected. I expected a series of diverse challenges across a simultaneously physical and mental obstacle course that centred around olympiad type mathematics. It was not that, instead I found myself surrounded by Computer Science and EECS students from Berkeley and Stanford, competing in coding problems to see who can solve them the fastest and most effectively (and use Google's search engine as a tool of course).

I was probably more disappointed than not when I first arrived, as it was a lot less extravagant than what I initially anticipated. However, I was able to solve more than I expected, which boosted my confidence in my general abilities as a "TECHY".
