What a day, I'm flying into Japan to meet Jonathan Siegel, the legend himself in the flesh. I'm probably hyping this up too much, but fuck me if I'm not excited. Most the offer letters felt really strange to me: these were companies that valued prim-and-proper, by the book decision making. They crafted narratives online how they were diverse workplaces that cared about hiring unique individuals who thought outside the box, but I never felt any... spirit or charisma come out of interacting with Deloitte consultants or Goldman bankers. They seemed caught up in their own world of semantics, probable office politics, maintaining shallow and facetious relationships that ultimately ring hollow. They call it professionalism and it feels stifling to me.

My parents want me to start recruiting for these companies since the process has started. I don't know how I feel about it. Everything I am, everything I do, is crafted around being the most genuine person I can be, even if it might momentarily put tension into the relationships I am building, I would rather there be tension in a genuine and transparent interaction than present a side of myself I don't like seeing in the mirror when I wake up. BlackRock, Deloitte, D.E. Shaw, Citadel, all these places I find myself hesitant about working at on account of the possibly endlessly bureaucratic systems feel like places where I might end up losing who I am.
