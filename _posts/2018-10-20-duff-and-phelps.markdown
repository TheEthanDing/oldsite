Duff & Phelps, an investment banking company, posted a case competition which challenged student teams to valuate a hypothetical public broadcasting company. Project specs can be found [here](https://ethanding17.github.io/assets/Duff_Phelps.pdf).

For me, this was my first taste of financial work of any kind. Although I wasn't able to finish every component of the deliverable, on account of entering the competition alone, I was able to learn a huge amount about the quantitative and qualitative elements behind business analytics.
