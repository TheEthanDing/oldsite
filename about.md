<h1>Hi, I'm an addict</h1>

<p>
My whole life, my dial for everything has two settings: 11 and 0. I'm either working 20 hours a day on a polyphasic sleep schedule, eating one meal a day until the <i>objective</i> is achieved, or I'm watching 8 seasons x 20 episodes of a TV show I discovered the day before, within a week. I'm not a go to the gym for 30 minutes of jogging kind of guy, I'm a stay at home all day or do 200 pull-ups kind of guy.
<br> <br>
If you're looking for someone who doesn't understand what "too much work" means, you've got the right guy.

<h3>What do I want to be?</h3>

<p>
I want to be a <b>full-stack entrepreneur</b>. I want to be able to write the code the engineers are writing, generate the sales and customers the salespeople are generating, negotiate the deals that the executives are negotiating, etc. I want to be a one-size-fits-all plug for any hole that appears in the ship.
